EGOCENTRISM BUFFING MOD:
Default values are not indicative of default vanilla values.
Default values:
	Allows Egocentrism to grant generic stat boosts when stacked
	Prevents conversion of other lunar items
	Prioritizes items of a higher rarity while maintaining randomness

Config Options:
(int)   Initial Health Bonus: 0
(int)   Health per stack: +5
(int)   Initial Armor Bonus: 0
(int)   Armor per stack: +5
(float) Initial Regen Bonus: 0
(float) Regen per stack: +0.3/s
(float) Initial Movement Speed Bonus: 0
(float) Movement Speed per stack: +2.8%
(bool)  Movement Speed Reciprocal Stacking: true
	= If true, movement speed stacking will have diminishing returns, up to the reciprocal stacking cap.
	= Useful to prevent uncontrollable movement at high stacks.
(float) Movement Speed Reciprocal Stacking Cap: 100%

(bool)  Bomb Stacking: false
	= If true, the above stacking stat bonuses apply with current bomb count instead of item count
(bool)  Primary Replacement: false
	= If true, replaces primary skill with a bomblet ability, unless you have Visions of Heresy
(bool)  Passive Bomb Attack Enabled: true
	= If false, disables bomb passive attack
(bool)  Active Bomb Attack Enabled: false
	= If true, using a skill will attempt to fire bombs at enemies
(bool)  On-Hit Bomb Attack Enabled: false
	= If true, bombs will fire at enemies that you damage
(bool)  Bomb Generation Enabled: true
	= If false, disables bombs completely

(float) Bomb Creation Initial Rate (IR): 3 seconds
(float) Bomb Creation Stacking Rate Multiplier (SRM): 0.75
(float) Bomb Creation Stacking Rate Subtractor (SRS): 0
	= Formula: IR * (SRM ^ Stacksize) - (SRS * Stacksize)
	= Has an overall minimum value of 1/60th of a second due to vanilla limitations
(float) Bomb Damage: 3.5
(float) Bomb Damage Stacking: 0.1
(int)   Bomb Initial Cap: 3
(float) Bomb Stacking Cap: 1
	= Rounded down after making the calculation.
(float) Bomb Initial Range Meters: 15
(float) Bomb Stacking Range Meters: 2.5

(float) Conversion Timer (T): 60 seconds
	= Set to a negative number to disable conversion altogether. Not recommended.
(float) Conversion Timer Stacking Multiplier (TM): 1
(float) Conversion Timer Stacking Subtractor (TS): 0
	= Formula: T * (TM ^ Stacksize) - (TS * Stacksize)
(float) Conversion Timer Minimum: 1
(float) Conversion Timer Maximum: 120
	= Set to a negative number for unlimited max time

Conversion Type: EGOCENTRISM
	EGOCENTRISM
		-items are converted to egocentrism
	LUNAR
		-items are converted to a random lunar item, not necessarily Egocentrism

Conversion Rules: WEIGHTED
	VANILLA
		-standard, no change. ignores rarity:priority list
		-same as setting all values in list to 1 and selecting weighted, random tiebreaker
	WEIGHTED
		-randomly selects based on weighted rarity:priority list
		-for a simple, random white/blacklist, set the priority of whitelisted rarities to 1 and/or blacklisted rarities to 0
	PRIORITY
		-selects the highest priority rarity available based on rarity:priority list
	CYCLIC
		-cycles through the rarities in order of rarity:priority list, with multiple times equal to the priority
	KARMIC
		-cycles through the rarities in a random order, with multiple times equal to the priority
		-weighted chance-based selection, with guaranteed tier selection before too long, based on rarity:priority list
		-resets "karma" every *n* conversions, where *n* is the sum of all priorities in the rarity:priority list
		-it's like if cyclic was weighted

Unavailable Rules: HIGHER
	= Does not matter if selected conversion rule is VANILLA
	LOWER
		-goes down the priority list to find next lowest tier
	HIGHER
		-goes up the priority list to find next highest tier
	NEXT
		-goes down the rarity list to find the next lowest tier
	PREVIOUS
		-goes up the rarity list to find the next highest tier
	REROLL
		-attempts a new conversion, without the unavailable rarity/ies

Rarity Priority Tiebreaker: ORDER
	= Only matters if PRIORITY or CYCLIC is enabled.
	RANDOM
		-randomly selects the tier every roll
		-may cause selection issues on cyclic. these issues can be avoided by using karmic instead of cyclic.
	ORDER
		-selects the tier that appears furthest up the list

Rarity Priority List:
	voidyellow:4,
	yellow:4,
	voidred:3,
	red:3,
	voidgreen:2,
	green:2,
	voidwhite:1,
	white:1,
	lunar:0
	= A priority of 0 blacklists that tier from Egocentrism
	= If a rarity is not listed here, its weight will be defaulted to 0, and thus cannot be converted by Egocentrism
	= Higher numbers means Egocentrism is more conditioned to select that tier of item
